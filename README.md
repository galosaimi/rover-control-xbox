# Rover Control via Xbox Controller


This repository contains the modified code for controlling a rover using an Xbox controller. The original code was developed by Rover Robotics and published as open-source before it was removed from their GitHub page. This version includes adjustments to fix performance issues and ensure smoother operation. <br>




## How to Run

To run the rover and Xbox controller, use the following commands:

1. **To run the rover:**

   ```bash
   roslaunch rr_openrover_basic pro.launch



2. **To run the Xbox controller:**

   ```bash
   roslaunch rr_openrover_basic xbox_controller.launch



3. **To run both the rover and Xbox controller:**

   ```bash
   roslaunch rr_openrover_basic teleop.launch
